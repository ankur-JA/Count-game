# Count Game using Material-UI and React
Welcome to the "Count Game" React application. This simple app allows you to increment and decrement a count using buttons. It's built with Material-UI components and React.

## Features
Increment and decrement the count with the "up-count" and "down-count" buttons.
Count is displayed in the center of the card.
Stylish Material-UI components for a great user experience.

## State Management with Recoil

This React application efficiently manages the count state using [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/), a state management library for React. Recoil helps reduce unnecessary component re-renders by providing a simple and efficient way to manage state at a granular level. This leads to a smoother user experience and better performance.

Recoil allows us to manage and share the count state among different components while minimizing the re-rendering of components that don't depend on the state changes. This leads to a more responsive user interface.

Feel free to explore the code to see how Recoil is implemented to manage the count state effectively.
